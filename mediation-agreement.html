					<p>Art mediators, like all mediators, have to be agreed by both or all the parties. That is another reason why experts with a good reputation for their special knowledge of both art and mediation have advantages in this special field. As accredited mediators, each of us will use a standard agreement (adapted for each case as necessary) produced by our specialist, world-renowned accrediting bodies, CEDR (the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution) or the C.I. Arb. (the Chartered Institute of Arbitration). That way, everyone can safely rely on the tried and trusted wording of two of the most prestigious such organisations in England and probably the world.</p>

					<p>A Mediation Agreement will be sent to the mediating parties for agreement prior to the Mediation commencing.</p>
