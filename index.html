			Reputation is important to everyone, especially in business - and especially in a business like art where trust is vital. Reputation is vital to the value, saleability and provenance of a work of art. Too often, legitimate disputes about value, provenance, title, damage, restoration and their effects‎ are fatal to the future of the artwork in question - and damaging to all those concerned.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mediation can be the answer. It resolves problems, provides agreement, and can help restore and maintain relationships, both personal and commercial. It is cost-effective and efficient. Mediation is effective to solve 90% of disputes. But art is a special subject. Art needs special care and special knowledge. Solving art problems and getting agreement to settle art disputes need trust.
		</p>

		<p>
			Specialist art mediators can make all the difference. A specialist art mediator knows the industry; (s)he knows and will help the parties solve the special problems and avoid the pitfalls that can waste time and risk misunderstandings on the way to a good settlement. Specialist art mediators are the people you can trust to know about both mediation and art.
